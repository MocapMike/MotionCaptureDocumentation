# Labeling Motion Capture Data: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Prerequisites:
1. **Qualisys Tracking Manager (QTM)** - Refer [How to download QTM](#) for instructions.
2. **Data Access** - Learn how to get the motion capture data from [How to access/download data](#).
3. **Basic Understanding of Motion Capture Data** - If you're new to this, start with [What even is Motion Capture?](#).
4. **Understanding Labeling** - Think of [Labeling as a puzzle](#) if you're confused about the concept.

## Step-by-Step Guide:

### 1. Launch QTM:
    * If you see "No projects", select it. (*This is the case for most users*)

### 2. Load the Data:
    * Click on the folder icon, alternatively, navigate through "files...".
    * Choose the trial you want to process.

### 3. Import the Markerset/AIM Model:
    * For **Markerset**:
        * Navigate to the "trajectories" section on the right.
        * Right-click and select "Load markerset".
    * For **AIM Model**:
        * Locate the toolbar with various icons.
        * Click on the icon that resembles a crosshair or target.
        * Choose "Load Aim Model...".
        * Ensure only your desired aim model is selected.
        * Click on "OK".

### 4. Label the Data:
    * If you've imported a markerset, it's time to label!
    * Drag the marker from the GUI to its corresponding label.  
      *(For instance: Right Shoulder Marker â†’ R.ACROM)*

### 5. Complete Labeling Process:
    * Continue the labeling process until all markers have been assigned.
    * **Tip:** Remember to save your work frequently.

### 6. Review and Verify:
    * Your objective is to achieve a "fill level" as close to 100% as possible. This is displayed on the right.
    * It's vital to ensure that labels are accurate. While QTM does make assumptions, always verify its accuracy.

### 7. Export Your Data:
    * Once you're satisfied, export the data in your preferred format. Refer to [How to export processed data](#) for steps.
