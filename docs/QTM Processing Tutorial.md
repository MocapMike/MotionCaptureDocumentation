#### This tutorial is intended for those who want to understand and perform the process of labeling (tracking/processing/work) of motion capture data. 


##### Some prerequisites:
- Have access to Qualisys Tracking Manager (QTM) *instructions on how to grab it*[How to download QTM ]
- Access to the data *instructions on how to grab it* [How to access/download data]
- Basic understanding of motion capture data [What even is Motion Capture?] 
- Confused about labeling? [Labeling as a puzzle]


#### Step-by-Step guide 
1. Launch QTM
	1. Hit "No projects" (This will apply to *most* people)
2. Load the data
	1. Click the folder icon (or in "files...")
	2. Load the desired trial 
3. Load in the markerset/AIM model
	1. MARKERSET: 
		1. On the right hand side under "trajectories", right click and select "Load markerset"
	2. AIM MODEL: 
		1. On the toolbar with all the icons, click the one where it looks like a crosshair/target 
		2. Click "Load Aim Model..."
		3. Make sure there is your desired aim model on the right side of the selection and only your aim model. 
		4. Hit OK. 
4. If using a markerset, this is where the labeling happens! Go ahead and click on the marker in the GUI and drag it to the corresponding label. 
	1. Ex. Right Shoulder Marker --> R.ACROM 
5. Repeat until all labels are filled!
	1. *NOTE*: Save often
6. Bada bing bada boom! Now do this forever. The goal is to get the "fill level" on the right hand side to be as close to 100% as possible. Now you just have to go through and verify that things are label correctly. The program does make assumptions and it's YOUR job to make sure it's assuming correctly... 
7. Export the data to your desired format [How to export processed data]
