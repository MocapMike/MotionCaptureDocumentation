Motion capture, or "mocap" as the cool kids say, is like a magical mirror reflecting real-life movements into a digital space. Imagine wearing a suit with a bunch of sensors/markers and you move around. As you run, dance, jump, or even swing a bamboo sword, your every move is recorded and translated into a computer. Your REAL movements become the movements of animated characters as you've seen in big hollywood movies. 


In OUR lab though, we go beyond entertainment. We're here to delve deep into the essence of human movement. With mocap, we can explore how athletes perform their explosive jumps or how a patient can regain mobility after an injury. If it involves a human moving, we can put a number to it and start crunching some analysis.
